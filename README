A suite of libraries and command line tools for doing ostatus.

Needed this to test things I'm doing with servers and I just 
can't get node-ostatus to work without giving me o3 library
problems. So I figured I'd port parts of it.

This has very limited functionality, thus far.

Committing to get the ball rolling.

Some command line scripts have been added: webfinger, profile and status.

Each takes one or more webfinger addresses:

    ./status evan@identi.ca

or 

    ./profile cdent@tiddlyspace.com
