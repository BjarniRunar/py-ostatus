A suite of libraries and command line tools for doing ostatus.

Needed this to test things I'm doing with servers and I just 
can't get node-ostatus to work without giving me o3 library
problems. So I figured I'd port parts of it.

This is no where close to working.

Committing to get the ball rolling.
