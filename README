A suite of Python libraries and command line tools for doing ostatus.

Needed this to test things I'm doing with servers and I just 
can't get node-ostatus to work without giving me o3 library
problems. So I figured I'd port parts of it to Python.

This has very limited functionality, thus far.

Some command line scripts have been added: webfinger, profile, status and
hcard.

Each takes one or more webfinger addresses:

    ./status evan@identi.ca

or 

    ./profile cdent@tiddlyspace.com

This code makes no particular effort to be super efficient, but it 
does try to be relatively simple and dependency free.

TODO:

Thus far all the code performs only read only activities. Nothing is
being done for subscription, PuSHing to hubs, or doing anything with
salmon. So all of that is a todo.
